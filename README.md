4. Return the response to user

__Training the Chatbot__
You have made a chatbot.Now, how it would produce the responses that you want for this there is a library called chatterbot-corpus. it basically has all the responses.We use it to train the bot.Then it generates the relevant responses that we want.

__Developing a chatbot using Flask__
We will make a flask chatbot. Flask is a micriframework used for web developing,follow the process:
1. Make a web app using the flask
2. Make a directory for the templstes
